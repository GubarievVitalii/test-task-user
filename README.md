## The work is done on React.

2. When clicking on the Follow button, its text changes to Following. Also the
   color of the button changes. Yours is added to the number of followers.

3. When the page is updated, the final result of the user's actions is recorded.
   That is, if click on the button and refresh the page - then the button
   remains in place the Following status with the corresponding color and the
   number of followers does NOT decrease to the initial value.
